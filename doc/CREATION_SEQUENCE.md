The main point of this doc is to provide some kind of breadcrumbs to follow in case I have to start from scratch and do it all over again.

Like it or not, starting from scratch and repeating sequence seems to happen a lot.

- git clone vp-starter
- renamed
- deleted and re-initialized git
- added doc, asset, rdx, wc, and rdx/model directories
- npm run service-worker
- tested with lighthouse
- added <title> per lighthouse
- added first 5 documents in the doc folder
- tried adding manifest failed
- added TOC and other doc changes
- added as many cool-ness enhancements to dev rollup as I could find and steal from elsewhere
